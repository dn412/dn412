### Hi i'm Daneiry 👋👩🏼‍💻 but you can call me Dani.

![Women programmer](https://github.com/dn412/dn412/assets/140428179/31ef26d9-7ca5-47b3-a938-168b5e7808b7)


I'm a software engineer currently completing a coding bootcamp.  I love how coding continues to train my mind and it's a never-ending process of lifelong learning. That is something I truly enjoy and appreciate. Before this role, I had a career in healthcare specializing in surgical technology and surgical assisting. Much like surgery, coding requires analytical thinking for problem-solving, and teamwork for solutions, and creates an impact on making a difference in someone's life. Through coding and programming, I'm creating websites, apps, games, and software that can help people, entertain them, or simply make their lives easier. Overall, tech is a rewarding field that I'm enthusiastic to shift into.
